        <p>A simple Angular application I created during my studies at Bellevue University. A user can log in to view
           the tasks page, and then submit tasks, which are stored to a MongoDB NoSQL Database. Tasks can be moved back
            and forth between the "Todo" and "Done" columns by dragging and dropping them thanks to RXJS implementation
        </p>
        <p>
          To log in and create tasks, the valid ID numbers accepted on the sign-in page are 1007-1012

          This is a group project that I helped create for a college class, alongside two of my classmates, Hannah Del Real and Jocelyn Dupis.
          It's a site for a fictitious computer repair shop, a user can log in either as an admin or a regular employee and submit a work order
          to a MongoDB database, while those with admin permissions can access a user configuration page that allows for creating, editing, and deleting
          users. <br> My personal contributions to the project included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instantiating the database and managing the team's database design strategy</li>
          <li>Writing API for the following: finding a user by ID, logging a user in, finding a user's selected security questions, and finding a work order based on
            a requested service</li>
          <li>Implementing the UI for the User Configuration page</li>
          <li>Designing the registration process, its associated form, and setting up the UI for it</li>
          <li>Implementing the forgot password process</li>
          <li>Creating the User Profile page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To log in and access the site's admin features, use the following on the sign-in page - Email: bob&#64;bcrs.com  Password: Adminbob1
